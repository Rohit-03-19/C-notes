// Problem statement
// You have a list of numbers that are not in order. You want to find the sum of the differences between the indices of pairs of numbers that are in the wrong order. A pair of numbers is considered to be in the wrong order if the smaller number comes after the larger number in the list.

// Example:
// Input: ‘N’ = 5 
// ‘A’ = [3, 2, 11, 5, 1]

// Output: 6
// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Input format :
// The first line of input contains an integer ‘N’, denoting the size of the array/list. The second line contains ‘N’ single space-separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
// Output Format :
// The output should be a single integer - the number of inversions in the array/list.
// Constraints :
// 1 <= N <= 10^4
// 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
// Time Limit: 1 sec
